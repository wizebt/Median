# Median
Median filtering is an efficient mean to remove impulse also known as Salt & Pepper noise from signal. Median filtering is a non linear process and algorithm complexity is the same as sorting. It is not separable and computation need rapidly increase with kernel size. 

Here is a collection of median functions implementing minim comparision algorithm for vector of matrix integers in RANGE.
Based on a specialization of sorting network,quick select,and three-way partitionning, histogram sort, median-of-median.

Especilly developed for image filtering.
